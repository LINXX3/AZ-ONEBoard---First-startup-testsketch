# AZ-ONEBoard---First-startup-testsketch
This repository contains a script to make use of almost all the AZ-OneBoard sensor features. It collects environmental data from a temperature and humidity sensor (SHT30), air quality sensor (SGP30), and a light sensor (BH1750), and displays the results on the Serial Monitor.
